- [ ] Queue with two stacks. 

Implement a queue with two stacks 
so that each queue operations takes a constant amortized number of stack operations.

<!--class StringsStack { }-->
<!--StringsStack stack1 = new StringsStack();-->
<!--StringsStack stack2 = new StringsStack();-->

- [ ] Stack with max. 

Create a data structure 
that efficiently supports the stack operations (push and pop) 
and also a return-the-maximum operation. 
Assume the elements are real numbers so that you can compare them.

- [ ] Java generics.
