**Intersection of two sets** 

Given two arrays a[] and b[].
Each containing nnn distinct 2D points in the plane. 
Design a subquadratic algorithm to count the number of points that are contained both in array a[] and array b[].


**Permutation**

Given two integer arrays of size n.
Design a subquadratic algorithm to determine whether one is a permutation of the other. 
That is, do they contain exactly the same entries but, possibly, in a different order.

**Dutch national flag**

Given an array of nnn buckets, 
each containing a red, white, or blue pebble, sort them by color. 

The allowed operations are:
- swap(i, j) - swap the pebble in bucket i with the pebble in bucket j.
- color(i) - determine the color of the pebble in bucket i.
