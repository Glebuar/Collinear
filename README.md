The **product backlog** helps the team break the product into more manageable pieces and build it incrementally in a series of short time periods called sprints. 

During the **sprint**, the team meets each day, in a Daily Scrum, to assess progress and make necessary adjustments. 

Along the way, the **ScrumMaster** keeps the team focused on its goal. The Scrum Master also removes impediments for the team, so everyone can focus and move forward with their work. 

During sprint planning, the team pulls a small chunk of items from the top of the product backlog to create a sprint backlog, and then decides how to accomplish those items during the next sprint. 


**Reporting a problem** - name:
1. **What** is the problem - what happened.
2. **Where** the problem occurred.
3. Under **which** circumstances it happened - can be skipped when writing a task.

**Steps to reproduce/understand** - detailed description, so everyone can understand.
